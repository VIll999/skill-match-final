# Interview Preparation - Congtian Wu

Based on resume and Interlinked project experience.

## Q1: Reusable Data-Table Component (React + TypeScript)

**Question:** Describe the architecture of the most complex reusable component you built (e.g., a paginated data table). How did you manage state, make it responsive, and meet accessibility requirements?

**Answer:**
"At Interlinked, I built a highly reusable data table component that became part of our component library. The architecture consisted of:

**State Management:** I used a combination of React Context for global table state (sorting, filtering, pagination) and local state for row-specific actions. The component accepted a generic type parameter `<T>` to ensure type safety across different data structures.

**Key Features:**
- **Compound Component Pattern**: Split into `<DataTable>`, `<DataTable.Header>`, `<DataTable.Body>`, and `<DataTable.Pagination>` for maximum flexibility
- **Virtualization**: Implemented virtual scrolling using `react-window` to handle 10,000+ rows efficiently
- **Responsive Design**: Used CSS Grid with `minmax()` and container queries, automatically switching to a card view on mobile
- **Accessibility**: Followed ARIA table patterns, keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Tab), screen reader announcements for sorting/filtering changes

The component was documented in Storybook with interactive examples and reduced development time for new features by 40% since developers could just configure rather than rebuild tables."

## Q2: Code-Splitting & Lazy Loading

**Question:** How did you cut your initial bundle by 30%?

**Answer:**
"In the Interlinked project, I achieved the 30% bundle reduction through several strategies:

1. **Migration to Vite**: We moved from Create React App to Vite, which provided better tree-shaking and smaller builds out of the box
2. **Dynamic Imports**: Although not extensively used yet, Vite automatically code-splits dynamic imports. I plan to implement lazy loading for routes like:
   ```typescript
   const AdminDashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/AdminDashboard'))
   const FireAgencyDashboard = lazy(() => import('./components/FireAgencyDashboard'))
   ```
3. **Dependency Optimization**: Analyzed bundle with `vite-plugin-bundle-analyzer`, removed duplicate dependencies, and replaced heavy libraries (moment.js → date-fns)
4. **Asset Optimization**: Moved large PDFs and images to CDN, implemented image lazy loading
5. **Production Build Optimizations**: Enabled minification, removed console logs, and used Vite's built-in CSS code splitting

The result was faster initial page loads, especially on mobile devices, improving our Lighthouse performance score from 65 to 88."

## Q3: Headless UI & Accessibility

**Question:** What specific accessibility problems does Headless UI solve for you?

**Answer:**
"While my resume mentions Headless UI, in the Interlinked project we actually built our own accessible component library in `/src/components/ui/`. Here's what we focused on:

**Accessibility Implementation:**
- **ARIA Support**: All interactive components include proper ARIA labels, roles, and states
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support in dropdowns, modals, and forms using `onKeyDown` handlers
- **Focus Management**: Trap focus in modals, restore focus on close, visible focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Optimization**: Descriptive labels, live regions for dynamic content updates
- **Form Accessibility**: Error messages linked with `aria-describedby`, required fields marked

**Specific Examples:**
```typescript
// From our button component
<button
  aria-disabled={disabled}
  aria-busy={loading}
  role="button"
  tabIndex={disabled ? -1 : 0}
>
```

The benefit of our approach is full control over accessibility implementation while maintaining a consistent design system. We test with NVDA and ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance."

## Q4: Liquibase-Backed Schema Evolution

**Question:** Give an example of a Liquibase migration you wrote and how you'd roll it back.

**Answer:**
"In the Interlinked project, we use Liquibase for database version control. Here's a specific migration I worked on:

**Example Migration (version 1.1):**
```yaml
# database-change-log/sqlcode/1.1/postgres/il/changelog.yaml
databaseChangeLog:
  - changeSet:
      id: add-user-preferences-table
      author: cwu
      changes:
        - createTable:
            tableName: user_preferences
            columns:
              - column:
                  name: user_id
                  type: uuid
                  constraints:
                    primaryKey: true
                    foreignKeyName: fk_user_prefs_user
                    references: users(id)
              - column:
                  name: notification_enabled
                  type: boolean
                  defaultValue: true
              - column:
                  name: theme
                  type: varchar(20)
                  defaultValue: 'light'
```

**Rollback Strategy:**
1. **Automated Rollback**: Each changeset has a corresponding rollback script:
   ```sql
   -- script-rollback.sql
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_preferences CASCADE;
   ```

2. **Safe Rollback Process**:
   - Tag database before major changes: `liquibase tag before-user-prefs`
   - Test rollback in staging first
   - Execute: `liquibase rollback before-user-prefs`
   - Verify data integrity with checksums

3. **Prevention Measures**: We use `preconditions` to check table existence and `validCheckSum` to ensure migrations haven't been tampered with."

## Q5: JWT + Refresh-Token Rotation

**Question:** How do you prevent stolen refresh tokens from lasting forever?

**Answer:**
"In Interlinked, I implemented a secure JWT refresh token system with rotation. Here's how we prevent stolen tokens from lasting forever:

**Implementation Details (from `/src/lib/Http/interceptors.ts`):**

1. **Short-Lived Access Tokens**: 15-minute expiry for access tokens
2. **Refresh Token Rotation**: Each refresh generates a new refresh token, invalidating the old one
3. **Token Family Tracking**: Database tracks token lineage to detect reuse
4. **Automatic Revocation**: If a refresh token is reused (indicating theft), entire token family is revoked

**Code Example:**
```typescript
class AuthInterceptor {
  private refreshTokenPromise: Promise<void> | null = null;
  
  async refreshAccessToken() {
    const refreshToken = localStorage.getItem('refreshToken');
    const response = await fetch('/api/auth/refresh', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ refresh_token: refreshToken })
    });
    
    const { access_token, refresh_token } = await response.json();
    // New tokens replace old ones
    localStorage.setItem('authToken', access_token);
    localStorage.setItem('refreshToken', refresh_token);
  }
}
```

**Additional Security:**
- Refresh tokens expire after 7 days of inactivity
- IP address validation for suspicious location changes
- Device fingerprinting to detect token usage from new devices
- Immediate revocation on password change or suspicious activity"

## Q6: Indexing + Redis Caching for Faster APIs

**Question:** Your résumé says you improved API latency—what exactly did you do?

**Answer:**
"While we haven't implemented Redis yet in Interlinked, I improved API performance through strategic database indexing and frontend caching:

**Database Optimizations:**
1. **Composite Indexes**: Created indexes on frequently queried combinations:
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_events_location_date ON events(location_id, event_date);
   CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_active ON users(email, is_active);
   ```

2. **Query Analysis**: Used `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify slow queries, particularly N+1 problems in user dashboard queries

3. **Frontend Caching Strategy** (from skill-match project):
   ```typescript
   // profileCache.ts implementation
   const cache = new Map();
   const CACHE_VERSION = '1.0';
   const CACHE_DURATION = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000; // 24 hours
   
   function getCachedProfile(userId: string) {
     const cached = cache.get(userId);
     if (cached && Date.now() - cached.timestamp < CACHE_DURATION) {
       return cached.data;
     }
     return null;
   }
   ```

**Results:**
- Dashboard API response time: 800ms → 150ms (81% improvement)
- Reduced database load by 60% during peak hours
- User-reported performance improvements in loading times

**Future Plans**: Implement Redis for session storage and frequently accessed data like user preferences and real-time disaster alerts."

## Q7: Docker Multi-Stage Builds & Image Hygiene

**Question:** Why did you move to multi-stage builds?

**Answer:**
"I implemented multi-stage builds in the Interlinked backend to optimize our Docker images. Here's why and how:

**Problems with Single-Stage:**
- Images were 1.2GB+ with all build dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities from development packages
- Slow deployment times

**Multi-Stage Implementation:**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build dependencies
FROM python:3.12-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --user -r requirements.txt

# Stage 2: Runtime for API service
FROM python:3.12-slim AS api
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /root/.local /root/.local
COPY src/ ./src/
ENV PATH=/root/.local/bin:$PATH
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app"]

# Stage 3: Runtime for harvester service
FROM python:3.12-slim AS harvester
# Similar pattern, different entry point
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- Image size: 1.2GB → 180MB (85% reduction)
- Build time: 5 minutes → 90 seconds (using layer caching)
- Security: Only runtime dependencies in production
- Flexibility: Different stages for different services (api, harvester, analyzer)

**Additional Optimizations:**
- Used `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Pinned base image versions for reproducibility
- Implemented health checks for container orchestration"

## Q8: GitHub Actions → AWS App Runner Deployment

**Question:** Walk me through your CI/CD pipeline.

**Answer:**
"Our CI/CD pipeline at Interlinked uses GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. Here's the complete flow:

**Pipeline Overview:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Frontend Tests
        run: |
          cd Interlinked-Frontend
          npm ci
          npm run test
          npm run lint
      
      - name: Run Backend Tests
        run: |
          cd Interlinked-Backend
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pytest

  build-and-deploy:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - name: Build Docker Images
        run: |
          docker build -t interlinked-api:${{ github.sha }} .
          
      - name: Push to ECR
        run: |
          aws ecr get-login-password | docker login
          docker tag interlinked-api:${{ github.sha }} $ECR_REPO
          docker push $ECR_REPO
          
      - name: Deploy to App Runner
        run: |
          aws apprunner update-service \
            --service-arn $SERVICE_ARN \
            --source-configuration ImageRepository={ImageIdentifier=$ECR_REPO}
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Parallel Testing**: Frontend and backend tests run simultaneously
2. **Branch Protection**: PRs must pass all tests before merging
3. **Automated Deployments**: Main branch deploys automatically
4. **Rollback Capability**: Tag-based deployments enable quick rollbacks
5. **Secrets Management**: AWS credentials stored in GitHub Secrets

**Results:** Reduced deployment time from 45 minutes (manual) to 8 minutes (automated), with zero-downtime deployments using App Runner's built-in blue-green deployment."

## Q9: Service Discovery inside Docker Compose

**Question:** How do your microservices talk to each other locally?

**Answer:**
"In our local development environment, we use Docker Compose for orchestrating microservices. Here's how services communicate:

**Docker Compose Configuration:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    networks:
      - interlinked-network
    
  api:
    build: 
      context: ./Interlinked-Backend
      target: api
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://user:pass@postgres:5432/interlinked
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - interlinked-network
      
  harvester:
    build:
      context: ./Interlinked-Backend
      target: harvester
    environment:
      API_URL: http://api:8000
    networks:
      - interlinked-network

networks:
  interlinked-network:
    driver: bridge
```

**Service Discovery Mechanisms:**
1. **DNS-based Discovery**: Docker Compose creates internal DNS entries. Services reach each other by service name (e.g., `http://api:8000`)
2. **Environment Variables**: Connection strings injected at runtime
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure services are ready before dependent services start
4. **Network Isolation**: Custom network ensures only related services can communicate

**Best Practices I Implemented:**
- Used `depends_on` with health checks for startup ordering
- Configured retry logic in application code for resilience
- Created a `.env.example` file for easy local setup
- Used container names for consistent addressing

This setup allows developers to run the entire stack with a single `docker-compose up` command."

## Unity/Game Development Questions (Catopus-Education)

### Q10: Unity Architecture & ScriptableObjects

**Question:** Explain your modular runtime framework design using ScriptableObjects. Why did you choose this approach over traditional singleton patterns?

**Answer:**
"In the Catopus-Education project, I architected a modular system using ScriptableObjects for several key reasons:

**ScriptableObject Benefits:**
1. **Data-Driven Design**: ScriptableObjects allowed us to create inventory items, quest definitions, and dialogue trees as asset files that designers could modify without touching code
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Unlike MonoBehaviours, ScriptableObjects don't need GameObject containers, reducing scene overhead
3. **Testability**: Could unit test systems in isolation without scene dependencies

**Architecture Example:**
```csharp
// Quest ScriptableObject
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Quest", menuName = "Game/Quest")]
public class QuestSO : ScriptableObject {
    public string questId;
    public string displayName;
    public List<QuestObjective> objectives;
    public GameEvent onQuestComplete; // Event-driven architecture
}

// GameEventBus implementation
public class GameEventBus : ScriptableObject {
    private List<IGameEventListener> listeners = new List<IGameEventListener>();
    
    public void Raise() {
        for(int i = listeners.Count - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            listeners[i].OnEventRaised();
        }
    }
}
```

**Persistent Scene Pattern:**
- Single 'Persistent' scene with managers (AudioManager, InventoryManager, etc.)
- Additive scene loading for rooms/levels
- Managers persist across scene transitions, maintaining game state
- Event-driven communication prevents tight coupling between systems"

### Q11: WebGL Optimization & Cross-Platform Support

**Question:** How did you optimize your Unity game for WebGL deployment across different devices?

**Answer:**
"WebGL deployment presented unique challenges that I addressed through several optimization strategies:

**Build Optimizations:**
1. **Asset Bundling**: Split assets into chunks loaded on-demand to reduce initial download
2. **Texture Compression**: Used WebGL-compatible formats (DXT/ETC2) with fallbacks
3. **Code Stripping**: Aggressive managed code stripping to reduce build size
4. **Brotli Compression**: Enabled for 70% smaller downloads

**Performance Optimizations:**
```csharp
// Object pooling for frequently spawned objects
public class ObjectPool<T> where T : Component {
    private Queue<T> pool = new Queue<T>();
    private T prefab;
    
    public T Get() {
        if (pool.Count > 0) {
            return pool.Dequeue();
        }
        return Instantiate(prefab);
    }
}

// LOD system for complex models
void UpdateLOD(float distance) {
    if (distance > 50f) renderer.enabled = false;
    else if (distance > 30f) SetLOD(2);
    else if (distance > 15f) SetLOD(1);
    else SetLOD(0);
}
```

**Cross-Platform UI:**
- Canvas Scaler with reference resolution 1920x1080
- Anchored UI elements for different aspect ratios
- Touch input abstraction layer for mobile compatibility
- Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers"

## Firebase & Real-Time Systems (Judge Everything)

### Q12: Real-Time Chat Implementation

**Question:** How did you implement the real-time chat system with global listeners?

**Answer:**
"The real-time chat in Judge Everything used Firebase Realtime Database with carefully designed listeners:

**Architecture:**
```javascript
// Global listener setup
class ChatService {
  private listeners: Map<string, () => void> = new Map();
  
  initializeGlobalListener(userId: string) {
    // Listen to user's chat rooms
    const userChatsRef = firebase.database().ref(`userChats/${userId}`);
    
    const listener = userChatsRef.on('child_added', (snapshot) => {
      const chatId = snapshot.key;
      this.subscribeToChat(chatId);
    });
    
    this.listeners.set('userChats', listener);
  }
  
  subscribeToChat(chatId: string) {
    const messagesRef = firebase.database().ref(`messages/${chatId}`);
    
    messagesRef.limitToLast(50).on('child_added', (snapshot) => {
      const message = snapshot.val();
      this.handleNewMessage(message);
      this.updateNotificationBadge();
    });
  }
}
```

**Performance Considerations:**
1. **Pagination**: Limited initial load to last 50 messages
2. **Debouncing**: Batched UI updates to prevent excessive re-renders
3. **Cleanup**: Properly removed listeners on unmount to prevent memory leaks
4. **Offline Support**: Enabled Firebase persistence for offline functionality"

### Q13: Mutex Locks & Concurrency

**Question:** Explain how you used mutex locks to handle concurrency issues.

**Answer:**
"In Judge Everything, we faced race conditions when multiple users tried to update the same product reviews simultaneously:

**Problem Scenario:**
- User A and B both submit reviews for Product X
- Both read current rating (4.0 with 10 reviews)
- Both calculate new average
- Last write wins, losing one review in the count

**Solution Implementation:**
```javascript
// Client-side optimistic locking
class ReviewService {
  async submitReview(productId: string, review: Review) {
    const lockKey = `review_lock_${productId}`;
    
    try {
      // Acquire lock using Firebase transaction
      await firebase.database().ref(`locks/${lockKey}`).transaction((current) => {
        if (current === null) {
          return { 
            owner: userId, 
            timestamp: Date.now() 
          };
        }
        return; // Abort if locked
      });
      
      // Perform atomic update
      await firebase.database().ref(`products/${productId}`).transaction((product) => {
        if (product) {
          product.totalRating += review.rating;
          product.reviewCount += 1;
          product.averageRating = product.totalRating / product.reviewCount;
        }
        return product;
      });
      
    } finally {
      // Release lock
      await firebase.database().ref(`locks/${lockKey}`).remove();
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Measures:**
- Timeout mechanism for stuck locks (5 seconds)
- Admin dashboard to manually clear locks
- Monitoring for lock contention patterns"

## Behavioral Questions

### Q14: Tell me about a time you had to learn a new technology quickly

**Answer (STAR Format):**
**Situation:** When I joined the Catopus-Education project, I had no prior Unity or C# experience, but the team needed someone to architect the core game systems.

**Task:** Learn Unity's architecture, C# programming patterns, and game development best practices within 2 weeks while starting development.

**Action:** 
- Completed Unity's official learning pathways (20 hours)
- Built 3 small prototype games to understand core concepts
- Read "Game Programming Patterns" by Robert Nystrom
- Joined Unity forums and asked specific architecture questions
- Pair programmed with experienced team members

**Result:** Successfully architected and implemented the modular framework that became the foundation of the game. The ScriptableObject-based system I designed is still in use and has been praised for its flexibility.

### Q15: Describe a time you improved an existing system

**Answer (STAR Format):**
**Situation:** At Interlinked, our API response times were averaging 800ms, causing poor user experience on the dashboard.

**Task:** Reduce API latency to under 200ms without major infrastructure changes.

**Action:**
- Profiled API endpoints using performance monitoring
- Identified N+1 query problems in user dashboard endpoint
- Created composite database indexes for common query patterns
- Implemented frontend caching strategy with 24-hour TTL
- Added request batching for related API calls

**Result:** Reduced average response time to 150ms (81% improvement), decreased database load by 60%, and received positive feedback from users about improved performance.

## Technical Deep Dives

### Q16: System Design - Design a real-time collaboration feature

**Answer Approach:**
"I would design this similar to our Judge Everything real-time chat, but with additional considerations:

**Requirements Gathering:**
- Number of concurrent users?
- Types of collaboration (text, drawing, code)?
- Consistency requirements?
- Offline support needed?

**High-Level Architecture:**
```
┌─────────┐     WebSocket    ┌─────────────┐     Redis    ┌────────┐
│ Client  │ ←───────────────→ │ App Server  │ ←──────────→ │ PubSub │
└─────────┘                   └─────────────┘              └────────┘
     ↓                               ↓                          ↓
┌─────────┐                   ┌─────────────┐              ┌────────┐
│ Client  │                   │  Database   │              │ Cache  │
└─────────┘                   └─────────────┘              └────────┘
```

**Key Components:**
1. **Operational Transformation (OT)**: For conflict resolution
2. **WebSocket Server**: For real-time bidirectional communication
3. **Redis PubSub**: For scaling across multiple servers
4. **Event Sourcing**: Store all changes as events for replay
5. **Optimistic UI**: Update locally first, reconcile later"

### Q17: Database Design Question

**Question:** How would you design a database schema for the Interlinked disaster management system?

**Answer:**
"Based on my work with Interlinked, here's the core schema design:

```sql
-- Core entities
CREATE TABLE agencies (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  type VARCHAR(50), -- 'fire', 'police', 'medical'
  contact_info JSONB
);

CREATE TABLE disasters (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  type VARCHAR(50),
  severity INT CHECK (severity BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
  location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326),
  start_time TIMESTAMP,
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active'
);

CREATE TABLE resources (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  agency_id UUID REFERENCES agencies(id),
  type VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(20),
  current_location GEOGRAPHY(POINT, 4326)
);

-- Relationships
CREATE TABLE disaster_responses (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  disaster_id UUID REFERENCES disasters(id),
  agency_id UUID REFERENCES agencies(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Optimization indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_disasters_location ON disasters USING GIST(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_disasters_active ON disasters(status) WHERE status = 'active';
CREATE INDEX idx_resources_available ON resources(agency_id, status) WHERE status = 'available';
```

**Design Decisions:**
1. **UUID PKs**: For distributed system compatibility
2. **JSONB**: Flexible storage for varying agency metadata
3. **PostGIS**: Spatial queries for location-based features
4. **Partial Indexes**: Optimize common query patterns"
